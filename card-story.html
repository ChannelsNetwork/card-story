        <h1>The Devastation in Puerto Rico, as Seen From Above</h1>
        <p>Last week, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 155 miles an hour, leaving the United States
          commonwealth on the brink of a humanitarian crisis. The storm left 80 percent of crop value destroyed, 60 percent
          of the island without water and almost the entire island without power.</p>
